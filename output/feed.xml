                <p>Recently, I was browsing the internet, hoping to find some news about the long-untouched Sailfish OS port for the Nexus 4. According to the <a href="https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/Adaptations/libhybris/Install_SailfishOS_for_mako">merproject site</a> the latest Sailfish port for the Nexus 4 is still the gamma 8 version, which corresponds to Sailfish OS 2.0.5.6 (file list <a href="http://images.devaamo.fi/sfe/mako/">here</a>).</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, today I was browsing the <a href="https://4pda.ru/forum/index.php?showtopic=559889&amp;st=780">4pda.ru forum about the Sailfish OS port for the Nexus 4</a> where someone posted a link to the sailfish os mako release version 2.1.3.7 based on CM-13 .</p>
<p><a href="https://yadi.sk/d/huAt-End3S4H7x">Here is the download link for both the Cyanogenmod 13 SNAPSHOT and Sailfish OS mako version 2.1.3.7</a>.</p>
<p>So let’s take a look how this stuff works.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9iedgub0">Installation</h2>
<p>I am using the <a href="https://eu.dl.twrp.me/mako/">latest TWRP recovery for Nexus 4</a>.</p>
<p>The installations instructions are totally the same as <a href="../sailfish-os-on-nexus-4/">in my last post about Sailfish OS on the Nexus 4</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a quick run-down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backup first (duh)</li>
<li>Flash the latest TWRP recovery</li>
<li>Make a full wipe in the recovery (go to Advanced Wipe and check everything)</li>
<li>Transfer both .zip files to the phone</li>
<li>Install the cm-13-xx.zip</li>
<li>Install sailfishos-xx.zip</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Oh yeah, I am not responsible if you brick your device. Also, you lose all your data in the process of installation.</strong></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9iedgub1">Review Sailfish OS 2.1.3.7 on Nexus 4</h2>
<p>Now, let’s take a look how this Sailfish version works.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, there is directly one really big flaw: The camera doesn’t work! I haven’t found out the reason for that yet, but I will keep this blog page updated for more news.</p>
<p>Bluetooth seems to work just fine (in contrary to <a href="../sailfish-os-on-nexus-4/">my previous post</a>).</p>
<p>However, the Jolla AppStore still doesn’t really work (it refuses to download the stock apps), but apparently it is possible to add open repositories (which don’t require authentication), and obtain apps from there. Last but not least you could always install the .rpm’s manually.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9iedgub2">Screenshots Sailfish OS 2.1.3.7 on Nexus 4</h2>
<p>Here are some screenshots:</p>

<p><em>Sailfish 2.1 on Nexus 4, camera issue</em></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9iedgub3">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is nice that porters are still at work. But the camera, which is not working, is, until now, a deal breaker. For the future maybe I will dive deeper into the actual porting process, perhaps build it myself.</p>
<p>For now, I will keep this page updated to any new developments regarding the state of Sailfish OS for the Nexus 4 in 2018.</p>

                <p>In this tutorial I will show how to install Sailfish OS on a LG Nexus 4. This post assumes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are rooted</li>
<li>You have a custom recovery (I had the latest TWRP recovery)</li>
<li>You have adb, fast boot and device drivers installed on your PC.</li>
<li>You have a very basic understanding how this stuff works</li>
<li>You made backups (since you will lose all data)</li>
<li>If you brick your device I am not responsible</li>
</ul>
<p>Without further a do, here we go!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9ie25tg0">Installing Sailfish OS</h2>
<p>This tutorial will show the simplest way to install Sailfish OS on a Nexus 4. So stuff like Multirom aren’t necessary. First of all, download the latest Sailfish OS port <a href="http://images.devaamo.fi/sfe/mako/gamma8/sailfishos-mako-release-2.0.5.6-gamma8.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then download CyanogenMod <a href="http://cyanogenmod.org.ru/arh/cm-11-20141115-SNAPSHOT-M12-mako.zip">here</a>. If the links don’t work, feel free to <a href="../contact/">contact</a> me, I will upload this stuff to Dropbox or something.</p>
<p>After that, transfer the files to your device, using any method you are comfortable with (for example <code>adb push</code>).</p>
<p>Now, boot your device to recovery, install first the CyanogenMod zip (<em>flash zip</em>), and directly after that (without restarting) the Sailfishos zip. Then restart your device.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/21/installing_zip_sailfishos.jpg" alt="Flashing Sailfish OS on Nexus 4" width="500" height="667"></p>
<p><em>installing the zip files</em></p>
<p>Sailfish OS should boot just fine.</p>
<p>It should be noted, that not all of the stuff worked for me (for example Bluetooth).</p>
<p>For more information you should see the <a href="https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/Adaptations/libhybris/Install_SailfishOS_for_mako">official site of the Sailfish OS port for the Nexus 4 here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9ie25tg1">Sailfish OS on Nexus 4 in action.</h2>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/21/sailfish-os-in-action-1.jpg" alt="Sailfish OS in action on Nexus 4" width="500" height="375"></p>

<p><em>Sailfish OS on Nexus 4 in action</em></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9ie25tg2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is a very nice way, to get a glimpse at Sailfish OS, without buying a dedicated phone (which are, right now, quite hard to find).</p>

<p><em>An example post using PythonCMS</em></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d9idnvd00">Advantages of PythonCMS</h3>
<ul>
<li>No config files</li>
<li>It fully portable</li>
<li>No local webserver required</li>
<li>Very easy theming</li>
<li>Easy Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
<li>AMP &amp; Analytics support</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9idnvd01">Quickstart guide</h2>
<p>It is very easy to get started with PythonCMS.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d9idnvd02">Installing Python 3</h3>
<p>Make sure you have installed Python 3.x (any version 3 will work). If not, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">download Python 3 here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d9idnvd03">Cloning the repository</h3>
<p>Clone the PythonCMS repository into the directory of your future site (or blog):</p>
<pre><code>
git clone https://github.com/martinkaptein/pythonCMS.git
cd pythonCMS
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively you can <a href="https://github.com/martinkaptein/pythonCMS/archive/master.zip">download the PythonCMS zip archive here</a>. </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d9idnvd04">Customizing the main page</h3>
<p>Edit the <code>index.html</code> file in the root of the directory. This will become the main page of the blog (or site).</p>
<p>I recommend to change the links for the social networks. Feel free to adjust everything to your liking except for the <code>$InsertLatestPostBelow</code> tag. It is required for the script to work.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d9idnvd05">Writing your first blog post</h3>
<p>Your working directory is inside the <code>drafts/drafts</code> folder.</p>
<p>Write your first blog entry in <code>drafts/drafts/draft.html</code> or <code>drafts/drafts/example.html</code>. Again, change it however you want.</p>
<p>For future posts you can create or rename any *.html files inside the <code>drafts/drafts</code> folder. You have full freedom!</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1d9idnvd06">Adding media to the blog post</h4>
<p>For media (such as images) put them into the media folder (<code>media/</code>) and link 2 levels up from your draft.html:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;img alt="description of your picture" src="../../media/yourpicture.jpg" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1d9idnvd07">Analytics and SEO</h4>
<p>Add any meta, script etc. tags as you would do normally. There are explanatory comments. </p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1d9idnvd08">Previewing your post</h4>
<p>Preview your post by opening the <code>draft.html</code> file you just edited (no local webserver neccessary for preview).</p>
<p>However, it is still good practise to use a simple webserver like:</p>
<pre><code>
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
</code></pre>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d9idnvd09">Generating the site</h3>
<p>Now it's time to build the site!</p>
<p>Run pythonCMS.py:</p>
<pre><code>
python pythonCMS.py
</code></pre>
<p>If you have 2 python installations run:</p>
<pre><code>
python3 pythonCMS.py
</code></pre>
<p>The instructions on screen will guide you through the process.</p>
<p>After that just upload the whole folder to your site (ftp, ssh, whatever). Since PythonCMS is fully portable this is possible without problems.</p>
<p>I even included a <code>robots.txt</code> to exclude the drafts from being indexed by search engines.</p>
<p>Done!</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/20/pythoncms_terminal.jpg" alt="Running PythonCMS in the Terminal" width="1870" height="306"></p>
<p><em>Running PythonCMS from Terminal</em></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9idnvd0a">Theming</h2>
<p>This is the easy part! Basically you can change everything <strong>except</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$InsertLatestPostBelow</code> (in the root <code>index.html</code>) since it's required for PythonCMS to generate the menu system (feel free to relocate it)</li>
<li>For styling and javascript, make sure <code>draft.html</code> links 2 levels up:</li>
</ul>
<p>Like this:</p>
<pre><code>
src="../../assets"
</code></pre>
<p>That is it!</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9idnvd1b">AMP</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://ampbyexample.com/">https://ampbyexample.com/</a> for theming, then apply standart theming procedure for this static site generator.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9idnvd1c">Future release ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>add markdown support</li>
<li>backwards compatibility with Python 2</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9idnvd1d">Notes</h2>
<p>The default theme has been made and published by/at <a href="http://blacktie.co/">http://blacktie.co/</a> so it's not by me. Props for them for their amazing work!</p>
<p>Find the source at <a href="https://github.com/martinkaptein/pythonCMS">github.com/martinkaptein/pythonCMS</a>. Ideas for features and contributions are welcome!</p>

                <p>In this Blog post I would like to explore Google DeepDream and report about my experiences with it.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9i7asjp0">Introduction to Google DeepDream</h2>
<p>Google DeepDream is an <a href="https://github.com/google/deepdream">open source program, created by Google</a>, which uses a convolutional neural networks (CNN's) to find and enhance patterns in images.</p>
<p>This can lead to very cool-looking results.</p>
<p>What I like about Google DeepDream is that it provides a very visual approach and representation of an, otherwise, very abstract topic.</p>
<p>In this Blog post I will share some of my results and settings which I used.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9i7asjp1">The source image</h2>
<p>I used an image (which I took myself) of clouds:</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/19/cloudsw500.jpg" alt="cumulunimbus clouds" width="250" height="231"></p>
<p><em>My source image, input for DeepDream</em></p>
<p>In my experience the image dimension should be somewhere between 700 pixels sq and 200 pixels sq (not necessarily square, of course). Large images take an extremely long time to process, but can also provide really beautiful results.</p>
<p>Also, the size of the <em>Dream stuff</em> doesn't scale with the image (probably depends on the trained model).</p>
<p>Intrestingly enough, images with clouds tend to be most interesting. Humans do also tend to interpret different things when looking at clouds, so that's a nice parallel.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9i7asjp2">My results</h2>
<p>Here are some of my favourite results I got:</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/19/cloudsw500inc4cout.jpg" alt="google deepdream output" width="250" height="231"></p>
<p><em>Default settings</em></p>
<p>This is done, basically with the default settings of Google (but used <strong>98 iterations</strong>)</p>
<pre><code>
make_step(net, step_size=1.5, end='inception_4c/output', jitter=32, clip=True, objective=objective_L2)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
deepdream(net, base_img, iter_n=11, octave_n=4, octave_scale=1.4, 
          end='inception_4c/output', clip=True, **step_params)
</code></pre>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/19/inc4bout.jpg" alt="google deepdream output 2" width="250" height="231"></p>
<p><em>Layer: end='inception_4b/output'</em></p>
<p>Whilst you can see in the first image more or less complete dogs, here it's more ears and eyes. This makes sense, as it's a 'lower level layer'.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/19/inc5aoutx123.jpg" alt="google deepdream output 3" width="250" height="231"></p>
<p><em>Layer: end='inception_5a/output'</em></p>
<p>This yields a very abstract result. Probably my favourite. This particular picture <strong>used 123 iterations</strong> (more on that later).</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/19/inc5bout.jpg" alt="google deepdream inception output 5" width="250" height="231"></p>
<p><em>Layer: end='inception_5b/output'</em></p>
<p>Well, I leave this one to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: I had to down-scale these images, so that this site loads a bit faster :P I hope that's ok</em></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9i7asjp3">Modifications to the source code</h2>
<p>The only modification I made was to 're-dream' every image (quite a large number of times).</p>
<p>This helps to get a more vivid result.</p>
<p>Here is the script I made (it saves every iteration, so you can make a nice .gif or something later). Also, it doesn't crash due to memory issues.</p>
<pre><code>
for i in xrange(somenumber):
    frame = deepdream(net, frame)
    PIL.Image.fromarray(np.uint8(frame)).save("output/%04d.jpg"%frame_i)
    frame = np.float32(PIL.Image.open('output/%04d.jpg'%frame_i))
    frame_i += 1
    
</code></pre>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9i7asjp4">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I personally like this topic very much. Will probably write other blog posts about this too (for example, about using different models).</p>

                <p>In this blog post, we will, quite literally, take a look inside a dream of a computer and I will talk about the meaning of dreams, both, human dreams and computer dreams.</p>
<p>This is my second post about the topic of computer dreams, read the first, more technical, post <a href="../exploring-google-deepdream/">here</a>. In this case, I have worked with <a href="https://github.com/google/deepdream">Google DeepDream</a>, more precisely with a <a href="https://github.com/martinkaptein/deepdream">slightly modified version by myself</a>.</p>
<p>Like I have already stated in <a href="../exploring-google-deepdream/">my previous Blog post about DeepDream</a>, Google DeepDream is an open source program, created by Google, which uses convolutional neural networks to find and enhance patterns in images.</p>
<p>The post will be specifically about Google DeepDream, although can be interpreted, surely, much more general, in a very broad way.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9i6s92k0">Why Dream?</h2>
<p>Although, one might argue, it is quite far fetched to compare DeepDream to human dreams, there are interesting similarities.</p>
<p>For one, we human do quite a similar thing as Google DeepDream in our dreams: We, or better, our brain, or our subconscious, try to find patterns in the information we have received during our time awake.</p>
<p>Probably, dreams help assign a meaning to the ‘raw’ information - a higher level of abstraction. Though more primitive, Google DeepDream does exactly the same.</p>
<p>Also, there is the aspect of the (artistic) weirdness, which you can view for yourself in the following section of my post.</p>
<h1 id="mcetoc_1d9i6s92l1" >The beauty of computer dreams</h1>
<p>Here are some my results with DeepDream. The quality has been reduced to let the site load faster, links for the full-res versions are below.</p>
<p>As I was running Google DeepDream in a virtual machine, I took a very long time to generate those. For more technical stuff read my <a href="../exploring-google-deepdream/">previous post about Google DeepDream</a> or view <a href="https://github.com/martinkaptein/deepdream">my Google DeepDream fork on Github here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9i6s92l2">What is next?</h2>
<p>So, one might ask: What is next? What awaits us in the future?</p>
<p>Strong AI or even a Super intelligence? With enough data and computing power everything is possible.</p>
<p>Or so it would seem.</p>
<p>Ultimately, exploring things like computer dreams, neural networks and other implementations of biological results of evolution, helps us to better understand ourselves, the way ‘we work and function’.</p>
<p>Will it ever be possible to fully mimic and recreate the human brain, the psychology or even the spiritual components (depends on your own philosophy and beliefs, I will not touch on this topic further)?</p>
<p>Time, and more precisely, people with very bright ideas will tell.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: The future has many interesting things and discoveries waiting for us.</p>
<p>And that is definitely very exiting!</p>

                <p>In this Blog post, I would like to take a look at ADB, which stands for Android Debug Bridge. It is a tool, which can do a surprising amount of stuff, which I was pleased to discover.</p>
<p>This is an introduction to ADB.</p>
<p>For this, I am going to use my Nexus 4, about which I have already written a lot of posts running the latest Lineage OS (at the time of writing it’s 15.1), which corresponds to Android 8.1 (which is quite amazing for such an old device, isn’t it).</p>
<p>I am not really sure whether other devices also support stuff like ADB over network in their stock rom (please let me know in the comments).</p>
<p>Anyway, this post is just about my experiences with ADB so far, besides the usual commands the modders and rooters from you already know for sure.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9i6jru30">ADB installation on MacOS, Windows or Linux</h2>
<p>The ADB command line tools are incredibly easy to install: Just download <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/">the zip file for your platform here</a>, extract it and <code>cd</code> into it from your terminal or command line.</p>
<p>You can add it to your <code>$PATH</code> for convenience. On MacOS you can alternatively use homebrew to install the android platform tools (ADB):</p>
<pre><code>
(assuming you already have homebrew installed)

brew tap caskroom/cask
brew cask install android-platform-tools
</code></pre>
<p>On Debian use: <code>sudo apt-get install adb</code></p>
<p>Run <code>adb devices</code> to check whether ADB has been installed successfully.</p>
<p>Now, let’s get to the meat.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9i6jru31">Useful ADB goodness</h2>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9i6jru32">ADB shell access over network</h2>
<p>I was very pleased to find that I don’t need to physically connect my android phone to the computer in order to access the ADB shell.</p>
<p>Activate <em>ADB over network</em> in the Developer options of our phone. You will see your local IP address and port.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/17/adb-dev-options-screenshot.jpg" alt="ADB developer options screenshot on Nexus 4" width="488" height="814"></p>
<p><em>screenshot of Developer options in Android</em></p>
<p><strong>Warning: Deactivate this options as soon as you don’t need it anymore or if you don’t trust your network - anyone could gain access to your phone now!</strong></p>
<p>On your computer type:</p>
<pre><code>
adb connect 192.168.178.68:5555
adb shell
</code></pre>
<p>Now you will be in the ADB shell of the phone, without connecting it physically.</p>
<p>Type <code>ls /sdcard/</code> to see the contents of your home directory on your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you get <em>permission denied</em> errors, it means that ADB has no root access on your phone. However, we won’t need it yet anyway.</p>
<p>Here you can use the power of your most favourite UNIX terminal commands.</p>
<p>Taking a look in the <code>/system/bin</code> directory reveals more information.</p>
<p>Type <code>ls /system/bin</code> to view all of the commands.</p>
<p>Here you will find a lot of interesting stuff.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9i6jru33">ADB screen recording via remote shell</h2>
<p>For example you can record the screen of your phone directly from your computer (remote shell):</p>
<p><code>mako:/ $ screenrecord /sdcard/outputfile.mp4</code></p>
<p>This will start to record a video of the screen of your phone. Press <code>CTRL+C</code> to stop the recording process.</p>
<p>The recording will be saved in the home directory (/sdcard/) of your phone, which you can view with any android file manager. Using other directories might throw <code>Read-only file system</code> errors.</p>
<p>Or you can exit the shell and transfer the recording to your computer:</p>
<pre><code>
mako:/ $ exit
&gt; adb pull /sdcard/outputfile.mp4
</code></pre>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9i6jru34">ADB remote app installation</h2>
<p>Another handy feature of ADB is its ability to install apps. Of course that also works remotely.</p>
<p>Say you downloaded some .apk files on your computer, and want to directly install them on your android device.</p>
<p>Make sure that your phone is still connected using <code>adb devices</code>. If not, connect the phone again using <code>adb connect ipadress:port</code>.</p>
<p>Navigate to the place where you have your apk’s : <code>cd your/dir</code>.</p>
<p>Now you can remotely install your app using <code>adb install appname.apk</code>.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d9i6jru35">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg, there a great many more features that ADB offers. It’s very powerful. This openness is one of the biggest benefits of android, there are just so many possibilities. Sure, it opens attack vectors, but as they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that applies to Android, and, broadly speaking, technology as well.</p>
<p>This was just a brief introduction to the Android Debug Bridge protocol, there is much more, so hack away.</p>
<p>I really hope to have some time in the future, to take a more in-depth look at the “hidden” features of android. These features really can make life easier.</p>

                <h2 id="mcetoc_1d92l6sqd0">Old Technology vs New Technology - Comparing and analysing two wearable devices</h2>
<p>In this blog post I will make a point by comparing two wearable devices, one, which would be considered relatively dated and old, and one, which could be considered an example of <em>new technology</em>.</p>
<p>Is new and modern technology really superior to <em>old technology</em>? I will compare the <strong>Casio F-91W</strong> watch to the <strong>Xiaomi Mi Band 2</strong>.</p>
<p>I was inspired to write this post by a <a href="https://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/10/20/how-the-casio-f-91w-became-the-worlds-most-versatile-and-dangerous-watch/">2015 article by TheNextWeb about the Casio F-91W</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Before I begin, I would like to say that this comparison is not fair at all, as these devices have very different functions and are meant for different people</strong>.</p>
<p>So without further a do, lets go!</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d92l6sqd1">Casio F-91W</h3>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/16/casio-f-91w.jpg" alt="Casio F-91W" width="416" height="555"></p>
<p><em>The Casio F-91W</em></p>
<p>The Casio F-91W is watch manufactured by Casio (surprise!) from around 1991. To put that into perspective, that’s 27 (!) years ago.</p>
<p>It is the world’s first affordable and mass-produced digital watch. It is very accurate (accurate to within 30 seconds a month), has a battery life of 7 years and has many more features (more on that later). But most importantly: It’s extremely reliable.</p>
<p>This watch has an incredibly thrilling history: It has been frequently used by terrorist (yes, even Osama Bin Laden wore it), because it could be easily used by bomb-makers. It has been worn by everyone, from hipsters to Barack Obama.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d92l6sqd2">Xiaomi Mi Band 2</h3>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/16/xiaomi-mi-band-2.jpg" alt="Xiaomi Mi Band 2" width="362" height="479"></p>
<p><em>The Xiaomi Mi Band 2</em></p>
<p>The Xiaomi Mi Band 2 is a fitness and activity tracker, launched by Xiaomi in 2016. It is similarly priced to the Casio F-91W, and has also a rich feature-set.</p>
<p>Hence, I chose it for this, rather unorthodox comparison.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d92l6sqd3">Comparing the features</h2>
<p>Here a quick and unambiguous overview of the features of both devices.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d92l6sqd4">Features of the Xiaomi Mi Band 2</h3>
<p>The Xiaomi Mi Band 2 is mainly a fitness tracker. It has a motion sensor, can track your steps, can monitor your heart rate, has a sleep tracker. On it’s small OLED screen it can display the time (that’s a really handy feature) and the date, amount of steps, distance, heart rate.</p>
<p>It connects to your phone via Bluetooth (on Android it can be used to unlock your phone) and can display the kind of notification (for example it can show an icon for Instagram, Facebook etc.). Also it can vibrate, and shows incoming calls.</p>
<p>It has one button, with which you can scroll through the various functions.</p>
<p>By a flick of the wrist (which doesn’t work when you really need it) it can turn on the display (which is off, most of the time, to save battery).</p>
<p>By the way, the battery can last easily a month, and can be just as easily recharged.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/16/charging-xiaomi.jpg" alt="Charging the Xiaomi Mi Band 2" width="700" height="253"></p>
<p><em>Charging the Xiaomi Mi Band 2</em></p>
<p>It should be noted that the Xiaomi Mi Band 2 doesn’t need to be connected to the phone the whole time, it works just fine without it. But from time to time you should connect it to sync it.</p>
<p>So, as a matter of fact, you do need your phone.</p>
<p>Last but not least, it is water resistant (IP67).</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d92l6sqd5">Features of the Casio F-91W</h3>
<p>The Casio F-91W is mainly a watch (as opposed to a fitness tracker) so it mainly shows the time. It has an always on display, on which you can read (at one glance, mind you) the time (hours, minutes AND seconds) the day of the week and date (day).</p>
<p>Using the buttons you can read the full date.</p>
<p>The Casio F-91W has a stopwatch and Alarm function, for which you don’t need any phone with a bluetooth connection at all. It has an option to beep every hour and has a light for the display.</p>
<p>Also, you can switch between 12h and 24h modes.</p>
<p>The battery last seven years, and the watch is water resistant (I didn’t find any IP rating, but it seems pretty reliable).</p>
<p>It should be noted, that the time and date have to be set manually.</p>
<p>Now that we have the technical stuff out of the way, I can finally move to my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d92l6sqd6">Design</h2>
<p>Both devices are comfortable to wear, although the Casio F-91W is thinner (and a tiny bit lighter), which makes it, in my opinion, a little more comfortable and feel less bulky than the Xiaomi Mi Band 2.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/16/comparison-watch-thickness.jpg" alt="Comparing Casio F-91W and Xiaomi Mi Band 2" width="448" height="597"></p>
<p><em>Comparing the Casio F-91W and Xiaomi Mi Band 2 in terms of thickness</em></p>
<p>That said, some might prefer the Xiaomi Mi Band 2 as it’s much cleaner and there isn’t any text, which makes it much more modern-looking.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/16/watch-front-comparison.jpg" alt="Watch front comparison" width="527" height="415"></p>
<p><em>Comparing the Casio F-91W and Xiaomi Mi Band 2 front</em></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d92l6sqd7">My own opinion</h2>
<p>Now I am moving to the essence of this blog post. And ultimately it all comes down to what you really need and what you expect from a wearable.</p>
<p>For my, part I can say for sure, that I prefer the Casio Watch. For one, you don’t need to worry about charging it or syncing it with your phone.</p>
<p>However, most importantly, it is build for time, and that task it fulfils perfectly. You don’t need to flick your wrist or push a button (for which you will need a second hand:) just to view the time and date.</p>
<p>Of course, the Xiaomi Mi Band 2 can do much more, but it has also compromises. Sure, it is a fitness tracker (which the Casio isn’t) AND it can tell the time and date. But at the same time, I noticed that it didn’t really make my live easier: Every time I need to know the time I need to push a button, every month I need to recharge (but that is not such a big deal); if I want to set a quick alarm or even use a stopwatch <strong>I need to pull out my phone</strong>.</p>
<p>And with the Casio watch I don’t need to.</p>
<p>Of course, you will say, the Xiaomi Mi Band 2 is about fitness, and I agree with you. However, I, personally, can do sports without a fitness tracker, and don’t give such a big deal about amount of steps or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, as a tech guy I have to admit, that the Xiaomi Mi Band 2 can offer much more than the official specifications, if you use a custom (android) app. Potentially, you could mod the firmware, and there are much more possibilities than the Casio F-91W.</p>
<p>But even the Casio F-91W can do surprisingly much, as terrorist (unfortunately) even used it to build bombs and plan terrorist attacks. But that is nothing to be proud about.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I like stuff that is easily repairable, and in these terms the Casio F-91W also scores higher.</p>

<p><em>Casio F-91W disassembled</em></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d92l6sqd8">To summarise</h2>
<p>As I have already stated in the beginning <strong>this comparison isn’t fair at all</strong>. However, these are both devices, which are meant to be worn on the wrist, and from that point of view it does makes sense to think about what option would suit you better.</p>
<p><strong>The Xiaomi Mi Band 2</strong> is a fantastic product, it can really do a lot of things, especially if you own an android phone.</p>
<p><strong>However, keep in mind that all your data is shared with Xiaomi, and if privacy is important to you, you should think twice.</strong></p>
<p>I did some network traffic analysis, piping all the network traffic from my phone, trough a proxy on my computer. You will be really surprised seeing the amount of data shared, the moment you open the app. But that doesn’t apply only to Xiaomi…</p>
<p>Perhaps, in the future, I will dedicate another blog post to that - it is a really interesting topic.</p>
<p><strong>The Casio F-91W</strong> is a much more simpler product. It can only do a few things, but does these things very reliably and will never let you down.</p>
<p>It has a really rich history and is already a kind of legend.</p>
<p>As the NextWeb puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s simple, unassuming and reliable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s what I like about it. It will only be getting better with time.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and it doesn’t share your personal data to unknown who.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d92l6sqd9">Personal choice</h2>
<p>Ultimately, it is a personal choice for everyone.</p>
<p>Perhaps, carry both devices simultaneously:)</p>

                <p>In this blog post I will show how to build your static website with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> and deploy it to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> automatically using <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a>.</p>
<p>This can have a lot of benefits: For example, you can fix typo's directly from the Github web interface from your phone (without editing raw HTML).</p>
<p>Due to various reasons I decided to use different repositories rather than one repo with different branches.</p>
<p>Also, I kept the whole setup as minimal as possible. Hence, no bash script or travis command line tools are required.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d92ksgq60">Travis CI setup</h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d92ksgq61">travis.yml</h3>
<p>First of all, you will need to add a <code>.travis.yml</code> file to the root of your source directory. Please be aware that your operating system may hide the file.</p>
<p>Paste this into your <code>.travis.yml</code> file <strong>and edit it as necessary</strong> (instrucions provided).</p>
<pre><code>
language: go

go:
  - master # This uses automatically the latest version of go

install:
  - go get github.com/spf13/hugo # This provides the latest version of Hugo to Travis CI

script:
  - hugo # This commands builds your website on travis

deploy:
  local_dir: public # Default static site output dir for Hugo
  repo: &lt;yourusername&gt;/&lt;yourusername&gt;.github.io # This is the slug of the repo you want to deploy your site to
  target_branch: master # GitHub pages branch to deploy to (in other cases it can be gh-pages)
  provider: pages
  skip_cleanup: true
  github_token: $GITHUB_TOKEN # This is the authentication which you will setup in the next step in travis-ci dashboard
  email: yourmail@mail.com
  name: "Your username"
  on:
    branch: master
</code></pre>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d92ksgq62">GitHub authentication</h3>
<p>Let's setup the git authentication.</p>
<p>Generate a Personal Access Token from this GitHub page: <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">github.com/settings/tokens</a>.</p>
<p>Please make sure to check repo - full control of repositories (the rest you don't need to enable).</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/15/gh_access_token.jpg" alt="github access token for Travis CI" width="1267" height="754"></p>
<p><em>Generating a GitHub access token for Travis CI</em></p>
<p>Copy the secret key to your clipboard and head over to <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">https://travis-ci.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Enable your source repository and turn the following options to on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build only if .travis.yml is present</li>
<li>Build branch updates</li>
<li>Build pull request updates</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, scroll down and add a environment variable:</p>
<p>Set <code>Name</code> to <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> and paste your secret key (from the clipboard) to the <code>Value</code> field.</p>
<p>When you added it, it should hide the value and keep it secure (it is encrypted), according to the travis-ci docs.</p>
<p>The settings should look like this:</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/15/travis-ci-settings.jpg" alt="Travis CI dashboard settings" width="1648" height="749"></p>
<p><em>My Travis CI dashboard settings.</em></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d92ksgq63">Push to your source repo</h3>
<p>Now, it's time to see Travis CI in action: Just git add <code>.travis.yml</code>, commit and push.</p>
<p>The build process should start automatically and push to your GitHub Pages repo.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d92ksgq64">Summary</h2>
<p>To sum up, this is a very minimal travis-ci setup. It's worth noting that Travis CI will always check for and download the latest version of <code>go</code> and <code>hugo</code>.</p>
<p>To speed the process up, you could move the hugo binaries to your source repo. But for the sake of simlicity I have omitted these options.</p>

                <h2 id="mcetoc_1d92kg33r0">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this blog I would like to take a look at the state of modular smartphones in 2018 and philosophise about their necessity as well as some possible approaches to create a modular smartphone that makes sense. It should go without saying, that <strong>this blog reflects my own opinion (you have been warned)</strong>. So without further a do, let’s dive into it!</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d92kg33r1">The facts about modular smartphones</h2>
<p>First of all I want to start with a very quick summary of the facts and the general state of modular smartphones as of 2018.</p>
<p>There are indeed very fascinating attempts of modular smartphones; there are concepts and ideas, but also physical phones, you could go and buy right now.</p>
<p>Some of the latter ones would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>LG G5 (launched back in 2016)</li>
<li>Fairphone 1 and 2</li>
<li>Motorola Z2</li>
<li>Red Hydrogen</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/14/lg-g5.jpg" alt="LG G5" width="620" height="349"></p>
<p><em>LG G5</em></p>
<p>Directly, we can discern an important fact: Most of these phones (and others, that I didn’t mention) are only for a small portion modular:</p>
<p>Yes, you can add stuff externally to your phone, for example using magnets, clamps and pins to transfer power and data, but, with the exception of the Fairphone, those things are purely external. You cannot swap vital elements, as we were kind of promised, like the built in display, cameras or even processor / System on a chip (SoC).</p>
<p>Hence, we can very safely conclude that we are still very far away from implementation of concepts such as Phonebloks or Project Ara (which, by the way, <em>is</em> based on phonebloks).</p>
<p><em>As a side note, I would like to mention, that Phonebloks has recently put out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wwrIpv38nE">an interesting YouTube video</a>, which I encourage to watch. On that note, another video I encourage to watch is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcQxdjHlKO4">the video by Techaltar on why modular phones have failed</a>. He does a far better job explaining that than I do.</em></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d92kg33r2">Why aren’t there real modular smartphones?</h2>
<p>Let’s explore some reasons why modular smartphones don’t exist yet.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/14/project-ara.jpg" alt="Project Ara Phone" width="900" height="600"></p>
<p><em>Project Ara</em></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d92kg33r3">Bad for business model</h3>
<p>First of all, it’s not easy to create such a device: There have to be providers, who will provide spare (or updated) parts, as well as provide support for it.</p>
<p>For companies, it is probably not very lucrative to sell for example an updated camera sensor (module) for a phone, when it would be far more lucrative to market and sell a completely new device.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d92kg33r4">Technical difficulties</h3>
<p>But let’s hypothetically assume, that it wouldn’t hurt a company’s business model. Then there are actual technical difficulties of implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>how do you connect the parts (modules) so that they can function in a reliable way?</li>
<li>how do you integrate support for quick exchange of those hypothetical modules into the operating system? (driver support, data failsafe)</li>
<li>how do you make that whole contraption durable and robust?</li>
<li>how do you make it secure, from an IT standpoint?</li>
</ul>
<p>And as such there are even more topics, that I cannot think of out the top of my head.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d92kg33r5">Consumers don’t want modular smartphones</h3>
<p>As we know from humanity, technical difficulties cannot stop progress (think the moon landing). Of course technical difficulties designing a modular smartphone can be surpassed.</p>
<p>But then, one final question would remain: Who would want those?</p>
<p>It is not a secret, that it would be incredibly difficult to market modular phones to consumers, especially non-tech consumers:</p>
<p>They just want a phone, which looks nice and just works (although these points can be very much debated).</p>
<p>But how do you design a modular phone that looks nice? How do you market that?</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/14/fairphone-2.jpeg" alt="Fairphone 2" width="320" height="213"></p>
<p><em>The Fairphone 2</em></p>
<p>Sure, you could convince people to swap out parts when they become deprecated or stop working. But who would go for that?</p>
<p>A person would need to know exactly what parts fit that phone and where to buy those. Most people own phones for 2 to 3 years anyway, and then get a new one, which also <em>just looks and feels</em> more modern (there is undoubtedly a psychological element to that). The chance that, inside those 2-3 years something might catastrophically break, besides the screen (and maybe the battery) is still quite small.</p>
<p>A phone suffers from wear and tear anyway, so why don’t replace the whole phone after max 4 years? A device that you carry in your pocket all day (in contrary to a desktop pc), will inevitably begin to scratch and stuff, buying a completely new smartphone may be even cheaper than replacing a modular smartphone completely, part by part.</p>
<p>Also, you cannot expect people to carry extra along with them for example a bulky camera module (as it is, I believe, the case with the LG G5). Consumers just want something, they don’t need to worry about.</p>

<p><em>The Phonebloks concept</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d92kg33r6">My opinion about modular smartphones and an alternative approach with ideas for the future</h2>
<p>Alright, I have stated counterarguments to modular smartphones, but myself <strong>personally I am not against that idea</strong>. Far to the opposite: It is very important, that humanity finds out, how to build a modular smartphone that really makes sense.</p>
<p>Let me present a few ideas:</p>
<p>What if you could design a smartphone that actually looks nice but is very easy to disassemble. But disassembling I mean, that all of the components hide inside the body of the phone, but the phone can easily be taken apart with some instruments.</p>
<p>Those components can be off-the-shelve components, but they (with possible exceptions) should be easily removable with ordinary connectors, that are already used right now (for example those lego style connections).</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/14/wileyfox-swift-disassembled.jpg" alt="Wileyfox Swift disassembled" width="532" height="709"></p>
<p><em>Wileyfox Swift disassembled</em></p>
<p>For example, some components are very easily replaceable in the Wileyfox swift, like for example the camera module. But this is just a specific example, as this phone is still build in a poor way, and some elements are still very hard to exchange (for example the screen).</p>
<p>Another example I had lying around is the Nokia Lumia 800. This phone is build like a tank, looks beautiful, but you can really easily get inside and change the screen for example.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.martinkaptein.com/media/posts/14/nokia-lumia-800-disassembled.jpg" alt="Nokia Lumia 800 disassembled" width="1000" height="413"></p>
<p><em>Nokia Lumia 800 disassembled</em></p>
<p>To sum up: These exchanges of parts should be doable for <em>normal</em> people, but people who don’t really want to deal with the technical hassle (like most people) could just bring their phone to a technician (whose jobs will also become easier &gt;&gt; prices go down). On the other side, also a business opportunity (especially for small businesses).</p>
<p>These technicians could just install newer and updated components (and charge extra).</p>
<p>A modular phone with modules hanging from the outside will be notoriously difficult to manufacture and in the end, probably, won’t make sense for anyone.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="mcetoc_1d92kg33r7" >Conclusion</h1>
<p>To sum up, I am amazed by the idea of a modular smartphones, but those phones should be designed in a slightly different way. Phones should look beautiful, but also be durable and functional, and most importantly don’t get in one’s way. Technical people who want to change the components should be able to do that in an easy way, but the design of the phone shouldn’t force people to do so (it’s not like you have to change components every couple of hours).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, I am not the biggest fan of the trend of thinner phones, which are able to do less and less (there may be exceptions of course - I mean we don’t want to carry phones with VGA ports). I guess, a smartphone should look OK, but it shouldn’t be a fashion statement. A phone is, after all, a tool, which is supposed to make your life easier.</p>
<p>The (modular) smartphone of the future should be a true smartphone without compromises.</p>
